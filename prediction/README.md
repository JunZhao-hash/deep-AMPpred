Clear instructions for obtaining necessary data:
The external data we built is stored in the external_data folder, and each category is divided into a separate csv file.

How to evaluate deep-AMPpred on external data:
We provide the prediction code, and we support independent prediction for each category. Just modify the file address in the code to the input data you are interested in and the model saved for the corresponding category.
